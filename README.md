### **ABSTRACT**

Anti-predator defences are typically regarded as relatively static signals that
conceal prey or advertise their unprofitability. However, startle displays are
complex performances that deter or confuse predators and can include a spectacular
array of movements, colours and sounds. Yet, we do not fully
understand the mechanisms by which they function, their evolutionary correlates,
or the conditions under which they are performed and evolve. Here, we
present, to our knowledge, the first phylogenetically controlled comparative
analyses of startle displays including behavioural data, using praying mantises
as a model system.We included 58 species that provide a good representation
of mantis diversity and estimated the strength of phylogenetic signal in the
presence and complexity of displays. We also tested hypotheses on potential
evolutionary correlates, including primary defences and body size. We
found that startle displays and morphological traits were phylogenetically
conserved, whereas behavioural traits were highly labile. Surprisingly, body
size was not correlated with display presence or complexity in phylogenetically
controlled analyses. Species-rich clades were more likely to exhibit
displays, suggesting that startle displays were probably involved in lineage
diversification. We suggest that to further elucidate the conditions under
which startle displays evolve, future work should include quantitative descriptions
of multiple display components, habitat type, and predatorcommunities.
Understanding the evolution of startle displays is critical to our overall
understanding of the theory behind predator–prey dynamics.
